6. As a Treasurer, I want to mark water bills as paid when a Customer makes a payment so that the system can keep track of paid and unpaid bills.

7. As a Customer, I want to view my water bill and meter reading so that I can understand my water consumption and make payments.

8. As a Customer, I want to update my personal information so that my contact details and billing information are accurate in the system.`;
